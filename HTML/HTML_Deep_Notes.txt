HTML: HyperText Markup Language - In-Depth Notes
================================================

1. What is HTML?
----------------
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications.

- **HyperText:** Text containing hyperlinks that connect to other web pages or resources, enabling easy navigation.
- **Markup Language:** Uses tags to structure, organize, and present content on the web.

**Purpose:**  
HTML provides the foundational structure for web pages. It defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more.

**Advantages:**
- Platform-independent and supported by all browsers.
- Easy to learn and use.
- Forms the backbone for all web development.
- Works seamlessly with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).

2. HTML5 Features
-----------------
HTML5 is the latest major version of HTML, introducing many new features and improvements:

- **Multimedia Support:**  
  Native tags for audio (`<audio>`), video (`<video>`), and images (`<img>`) without plugins.
- **Semantic Elements:**  
  Tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<main>` provide meaningful structure, improving SEO and accessibility.
- **Form Enhancements:**  
  New input types (`email`, `url`, `date`, `color`, `range`, etc.) and built-in validation.
- **SVG and Canvas:**  
  `<svg>` for scalable vector graphics and `<canvas>` for drawing graphics and animations via JavaScript.
- **Web APIs:**  
  Access to browser features like `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `geolocation`, drag-and-drop, and offline support with service workers.
- **Entities:**  
  Support for special characters (e.g., `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`).
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Works with CSS3 for mobile-friendly layouts.

**Advantages of HTML5:**
- Rich multimedia and graphics support.
- Improved accessibility and SEO.
- Enhanced forms and user input.
- Better performance and offline capabilities.

3. Structure of HTML
--------------------
A basic HTML document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <!-- Metadata, links to CSS, scripts, etc. -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Visible content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document as HTML5.
- `<html>`: Root element of the page.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata, title, links to stylesheets/scripts.
- `<body>`: Contains all visible content (text, images, links, etc.).

**Advantages:**
- Clear separation of metadata and content.
- Easy to maintain and extend.
- Ensures browser compatibility and proper rendering.

4. Difference between Tag and Element
-------------------------------------
- **Tag:**  
  A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets, used to define the start or end of an element.  
  Example: `<p>`, `</p>`, `<img>`

- **Element:**  
  An element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag (except for self-closing/void elements).  
  Example: `<p>Hello World</p>`

**Types of Elements:**
- **Container Elements:** Have both opening and closing tags with content.  
  Example: `<h1>Heading</h1>`
- **Empty/Void Elements:** Self-closing, no content.  
  Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="desc" />`, `<br />`, `<hr />`

**Advantages of Understanding the Difference:**
- Helps in writing valid, well-structured HTML.
- Prevents errors in rendering and browser compatibility.
- Makes code easier to read and maintain.

5. Heading Tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
----------------------------------
**Explanation:**
- HTML provides six levels of headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`.
- `<h1>` is the most important (largest), `<h6>` is the least important (smallest).
- Used to define the hierarchy and structure of content.

**Example:**
```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<h3>Subsection Title</h3>
```

**Advantages:**
- **SEO:** Search engines use headings to understand page structure and importance of content.
- **Accessibility:** Screen readers use headings to help users navigate the page.
- **Readability:** Breaks content into logical sections, making it easier to read and scan.
- **Organization:** Helps both users and developers understand the structure of the document.

**Best Practices:**
- Use only one `<h1>` per page for the main title.
- Use headings in order (do not skip levels).
- Do not use headings for styling; use them for structure and meaning.
- Use headings to outline the logical structure of your content.
